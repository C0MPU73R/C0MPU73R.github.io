						<h2>The Way Life Will Advance To Higher Feats</h2>
						<p>The concept of artificial intelligence has been around since the early 1940s and 1950s, pioneered by computer scientists and mathematicians like Alan Turing and John McCarthy. The integration of AI in consumer electronics is a recent trend in the last 2 decades or so, and has pushed humanity to further feats. Although there is concern over the risks of AI, I will explain that the productive benefits of current AI technology outweigh the current risks.</p>

									<h3>Smart devices integrated with virtual intelligent systems</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Based on the efforts an innovations at several tech companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google, AI technology integrated into
								consumer electronics has manifested into the new normal. With it, we are able to simultaneous check email, messages, GPS, and calls. All of which
								we are able to control with less effort than before, through the use of the digital assistant.</p>

									<h3>How Far Artificial Intelligence Has Come</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Theorized for centuries and coming to theoeretical fruition in the 1940s and 1950s, the use of an artificial intelligence has been predicted to be invented for human use to the point where that is becoming an apparent reality today.

									<h3>Technological Advancement</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Ever since the breakthrough with the invention of the transisitor, computing has gone to new levels. This new level of Artificial Intelligence or "Thinking Machines", will revolutionize the computing and modern world. Applications ranging from personal computing, to finance, to the medical field.
									It&apos;s applications have revolutionized these and countless other industries in terms of effiency and work productivity. As long as it is properly maintained, AI will continue to help humanity achieve high feats.
